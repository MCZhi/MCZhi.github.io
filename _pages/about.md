<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the [UCLA Mobility Lab](https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/), working under the guidance of Prof. Jiaqi Ma. Previously, I was a research intern at the [NVIDIA Research Autonomous Vehicle Group](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/avg/) and a visiting student researcher at UC Berkeley in the [Mechanical Systems Control (MSC) Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu/). I earned my Ph.D. from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), where I conducted research in the [Automated Driving and Human-Machine System (AutoMan) Lab](https://lvchen.wixsite.com/automan) under the supervision of Prof. Chen Lyu.

My research focuses on the intersection of robotics, mobility, and artificial intelligence (AI). I aim to develop algorithms and techniques that enable machines/robots to interact with humans naturally and make intelligent decisions. My research interests include deep learning, reinforcement learning, and generative AI, applied to areas such as perception, prediction, decision-making, simulation in autonomous driving, and human-machine interaction. My work has led to the publication of over 30 papers in top AI, ITS, and robotics journals and conferences.
